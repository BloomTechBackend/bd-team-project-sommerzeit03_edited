# Sommerzeit03 Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder*

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 
* *For the most part I followed my design document, but I had to do some minor changes to better accomplish the functionality I wanted.*

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* *I, being a baseball fan, was able to take the point of a user that needed/wanted 
access to a specific baseball data. Then, following the design patterns I've 
learned throughout the course so far structured it, so I had a clear idea how to 
break the bigger problem into smaller ones. At the beginning it felt really 
overwhelming to do all the project by myself and how I would be able to actually 
connect all the functionality from scratch, but by tackling each problem one by 
one it definitely made things easier.*
*
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?

* *I got stuck a lot, usually I would stare at the problem for hours to try find a 
solution, but whenever I noticed I had no idea or solution, I took a break from 
the project and cleared my mind doing anything else, then out of nowhere (while 
I was not working on the project) some of the ideas/solutions came.
I did a lot of googling too and going back to previous lessons to refresh knowledge.*
* 
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?


## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
* *No stand-ups as it was an individual project.*
* 
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
* *I overestimated at the beginning of the sprint, then as I had each one of the
smaller problems I underestimated what I could accomplish each day.*

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
* *I would definitely listen from day 1 the advice of assigning points to plan
tasks, this helps with the anxiety of doing that complex of a problem.*
